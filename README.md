The farmers are the basic building blocks of the Indian Society as well as the Indian economy. If the lifestyle of the farmers is improved then automatically it will help to develop country's economy. My project provides the perfect solution for the farmers to chose perfect crop depending on the season and the crop which is going to predict the maximum yeild of the crop. The solution also provides the weather forecast to alert the farmers in case of any bad weather. Plotting the graphs against all the necessary factors verses yeild farmer will be able decide the type of crop.
